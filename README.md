# Year3ElectricCar
 
Hello reader,

This project was done for the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in the context of the third year course ELEC-H309 - Projet intégré - 202223 under the teaching of Michel Osée in the departement of Electrical Engineering. 

The goal of the project was to first drive a car with two motors, a battery and a driver powered by a dsPIC33 microcontroller. A powerful regulation code was written by myself to divide the movement of the robot, both rotation and along a line in three phases: acceleration, constant speed and decelerration. Then, the second part involved the conception of a numerical filter to receive sound waves just like in the Year3Telecommunication, and based on this signal the order to move was given to the robot by connecting a second dsPIC to the car.
